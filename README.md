I am a big fan of the Sonicare toothbrush, but I’m not a fan of how large the heads are and how hard they are to store between uses. Since my girlfriend and I share a base, we always have a need to store the heads when we’re not brushing our teeth.

Since my bathroom is tiny, I wanted to be able to have something that would hang on the wall. I searched online, but I couldn’t find any existing products that would work. Thus, I decided to design my own hanging Sonicare head holder.

## The Design

It is a laser-cut design made of white acrylic. The heads slide on, and the vents allow for any trapped moisture to escape. I used [nodes on the interlocking portions](http://www.jeremyadamwilson.com/lasercutting-nodes/) to make the pieces better fit together.

I used AutoCAD to preview the design in 3D to make sure everything would line up.
